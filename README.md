# binaryContactBook
Simple contact book application that writes and pulls from a binary file

Has functionality like any other contact book, add, remove, search, edit, remove.
This was more of a learning experience to get used to working with data structures and file I/O in C

To anyone who might ever download this and is not on a unix based system, delete the clear screen function and remove all calls for it to work!
